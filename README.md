# ðŸŒŸ SOPHY Embodied Evennia Server Docs

Welcome to the **SOPHY Embodied Evennia Server** repository. This project provides configuration files for running an AI-driven MUD server based on the Evennia framework.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **KEY/** â€“ Stores character or agent profiles like `MONDAY.JSON` describing personality traits and metadata.
- **RYM/** â€“ Includes reference lists such as `styles.json` with musical style descriptions.
